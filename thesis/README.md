- _rq1.ipynb_: Contains the figures used in Section Evaluation _(tex\evaluation.tex)_ to answer research question 1
- _rq2.ipynb_: In order to reproduce the results of research question 2 and 3, you have to download the format-corpus dataset and adapt the path in the notebook. The latest commit at the time of writing was _https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus/commit/4e4b9a34540f72612ba6eab2d28bccceb7a848ae_
-  _rq3.ipynb_ Contains the figures used in Section Evaluation _(tex\evaluation.tex)_ to answer research question 3
- _poc_ropsten.ipynb_ In order to run the experiment, you have to make an Ethereum account and set the sender and private_key variable. The address and private key used in this experiment is not safe to use since it was auto generated by Truffle. If the account used in this thesis still has some leftover ETH, feel free to use them.
