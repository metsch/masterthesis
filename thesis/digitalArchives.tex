\section{Hashing}
Generally speaking, the purpose of hash functions, in the context of a blockchain, is to compare large datasets quickly and evaluate whether their contents are similar. A one way algorithm processes the entire blocks transactions into 32 bytes of dataâ€”a hash, or string, of letters and numbers that contains no discernible information about the transactions within. The hash creates an unmistakable signature for a block, allowing the next block to build on top of it \cite[55]{dannen2017introducing}.
