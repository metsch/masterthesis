This master's thesis gives an overview of digital archives and the concept of trust, authenticity and integrity of data in archives and a method utilizing blockchain technology to strengthen these concepts. In a modern age where falsifying and manipulating data is easier than ever, it is all the more important to increase trust in public institutions where cultural assets are preserved.
In my master's thesis I present a decentralized Fixity information store on the Ethereum blockchain, Fixity is an attribute of a digital object that can be used to validate that an object has not been tampered with in a certain time interval. The Ethereum blockchain is so well suited as a fixity store because it represents a neutral third party that gains no benefit from manipulating the data in its care; with the ability and means to prove it, causing a shift from trust in authorities to trust in technology. Duranti (1998, 36) said that in ancient times "authenticity was not an intrinsic attribute of documents, but the fact of where the documents were kept, in an archive, temple or a respected public institution".
