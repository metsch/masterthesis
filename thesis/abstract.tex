A neutral third party which can demonstrate that it has no reason to alter or to allow others to alter the records in its care, and that it has the knowledge required for attesting to, and ensuring the continuing authenticity of, the records.  Ensuring authenticity is the key to the identity of the trusted recordkeeper or custodian, or, more  generally, of the records professionals responsible for assessing and guaranteeing over time the trustworthiness \cite[41]{duranti2009digital}.
Duranti notes that in the ancient world “authenticity [was] not an intrinsic character of documents but [was] accorded to them by the fact of their preservation in a designated place, a temple, public office treasury, or archives” (Duranti 1998, 36). The location of the originals, the repository, conferred authenticity \cite[29]{kirschenbaum2010digital}.
The frequency of citation and quotation of a digital document will help establish that information as a trusted source in the scholarly world and render subsequent unauthorized changes harder to enact without identification \cite[29]{kirschenbaum2010digital}.
